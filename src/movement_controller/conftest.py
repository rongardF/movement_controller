Root conftest.py — ensure installed (generated) interfaces take priority over source.

This file MUST live at the pytest rootdir (same directory as setup.cfg) so that
pytest loads it before test collection begins.

Problem: Python's default sys.path always contains '' (the empty string), which
resolves to the current working directory at import time.  When pytest is invoked
from within the source root (e.g. `python -m pytest` or `colcon test`), CWD is
`src/movement_controller/`, so Python finds `movement_controller/` (the bare source
copy, lacking generated action/msg/srv interfaces) *before* the colcon-installed
merged package at `install/.../site-packages/`.  This hook removes the CWD-based
entries from sys.path so the installed package is found instead.

Note: This is independent of --import-mode.  Even under --import-mode=importlib
(the configured mode in setup.cfg), test source files are imported via importlib
without needing the rootdir on sys.path — but ordinary `import movement_controller`
statements inside those tests still use the standard import machinery and are
affected by sys.path.
